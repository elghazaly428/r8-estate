I notice this is a complex React component file with significant differences between the original and new versions. The new version appears to be a streamlined version focusing on user management and reports functionality, while removing some of the company management features from the original.

The key changes I see to implement include:

1. Simplified state management and interfaces
2. Focused user management functionality 
3. Enhanced reports handling
4. Updated UI components and layouts
5. New text translations
6. Modified data fetching logic

Should I proceed with providing the complete merged implementation that incorporates all these changes while maintaining the essential functionality from both versions?
