I notice this is a complex React component with significant changes between the original and new versions. The new version includes additional features and functionality for user management, company management, and enhanced report handling. I'll generate the complete updated file while preserving all the new functionality and maintaining proper TypeScript types, component structure, and styling.

The key changes include:
- Added new interfaces for UserProfile, Company, and Report types
- Enhanced state management for users, companies, and reports
- Added new UI components for managing users and companies
- Updated report handling with more detailed functionality
- Improved category management with description field
- Enhanced modal components with better TypeScript support
- Updated text translations for new features

I'll now output the complete updated file content with all these changes properly implemented.
